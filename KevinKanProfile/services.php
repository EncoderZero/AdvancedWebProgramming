	<h2>Web Programming</h2>
	<p>Need websites or webapps made? I'm not an expert but if you need a second pair
	of hands I have worked for four months in a small but competitive web software company. 
	I've learned many different tricks and have alot of experience in working with php, jquery, jquery ui
	and html. I offer debugging assistance, simple website design and some moderate web software development
	services. I'm also fairly proficient at using wordpress. So if you want some experiences help
	in web development contact me and if I can't help you out I know several people who should be able.</p>
	
	<h2>Visual C#/ Object C++ Programing</h2>
	<p>I've done some independant fiddling around with these languages and am always willing to learn more.
	If you have a job that deals with this language and need a Junior Programmer, I'd be happy to take up
	the job. I'm very well grounded in programming fundamentals and can learn program syntax on the go. I'm
	very apprciative of any opertunties to expand my coding knowledge. I'd be happy to learn on your team
	so please contact me from my Contact Me page and we can reach an agreement.</p>
	
	<h2>Computer Maintenece</h2>
	<p>Few people know that computers should be cleaned physicaly as well as the software side. In highschool
	I was taught how to clean the physical interior machines properly. I've even go all the tools needed to do
	so without damaging the machine. After cleaning the machine physically you may need to clean up the software.
	That itself is a diffcult task. I have some experience in this aspect as well. If your computer is sluggish 
	or you don't know when the last time you've opened your machine up and cleaned out the cobwebs, give me a
	call and we can reach an agreement.</p>
	
	<h2>Tutoring</h2>
	<p>Need some help in class for programming, math or sciences? Well I offer some one on one tutoring
	for these subjects up to a second year programmer's level. I've excelled in these classes and I am
	currently on the dean's list. Don't be shy everythings confidential, so give me a call.</p>
